This is a quick demo of a Quarto website where we'll present `airquality` data.
To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: Temperature and ozone level.
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```

The data for this analysis are shown below using the `DT` package in R, an
interface to javascript datatables.

```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(airquality)
```
